1. 15-688 Final Report.ipynb - The final report of this project
2. Data Collection.ipynb - A notebook which shows the entire data collection pipeline
3. Data Preprocessing.ipynb -  A notebook which shows the data processing pipeline
4. ML model.ipynb -  A notebook with the CNN model
5. TCGA-LGG Clinical Data.zip - A .zip file that contains the clinical data of the TCGA-LGG collection
6. TCIA_API_Function.ipynb -  Some methods that are used to make request calls to the API
7. Time Comparison-TCGA-LGG.ipynb - Comparing the execution time between the normal execution and multiprocessing execution
8. clinical_data_list.ipynb - A notebook with a method that uses web scraping to collect the outcomes of a patient
9. gI.py - This python file has the getImages function that is used to collect images from the API
10. gSID.py - This python file has the getSeriesID function that is used to get patient Serial IDs from the API
11. gbp.py - THis python file has the getBodyPart function that is used to collect the body part affected in a collection
