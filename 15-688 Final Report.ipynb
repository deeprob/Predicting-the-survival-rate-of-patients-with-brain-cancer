    "A glioma is a type of tumor that starts in the glial cells of the brain or the spine. Gliomas comprise about 30 percent of all brain tumors and central nervous system tumours, and 80 percent of all malignant brain tumours. [[1]](#[1]) Since it is such a common type of brain tumor, it is important to predict the chances of survival of a patient in order to plan further treatment startegies at the time of diagnosis. Most patients are diagnosed based on Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. In this project, we use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to analyze these scans and predict whether the patient will survive."
